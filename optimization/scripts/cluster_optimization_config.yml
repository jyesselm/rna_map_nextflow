# Configuration for cluster-based Bowtie2 parameter optimization
# This file controls optimization settings for all test cases

# Global optimization settings
optimization:
  # Number of parameter combinations to test
  max_combinations: 200
  
  # Number of trials for Optuna-based optimization (if using optuna script)
  n_trials: 100
  
  # Read length assumption
  read_length: 150
  
  # Threads per alignment
  threads: 8
  
  # MAPQ cutoff for high-quality alignments
  mapq_cutoff: 20
  
  # Quality score cutoff for bit vectors
  qscore_cutoff: 25

# Cluster job settings
cluster:
  # Default time limit per job (format: HH:MM:SS)
  time: "24:00:00"
  
  # Default memory per job
  memory: "16G"
  
  # Default CPUs per job
  cpus: 8
  
  # Email for job notifications (optional)
  email: null
  
  # Job name prefix
  job_name_prefix: "bt2_opt"
  
  # Container path (Apptainer/Singularity .sif file)
  # If set, jobs will use the container instead of conda environment
  # Leave as null to use conda environment or set via CONTAINER_PATH env var

# Output settings
output:
  # Base directory for all optimization results

# Per-case overrides (optional)
# You can override settings for specific cases by adding entries here

  # Example:
  # case_1:
  #   max_combinations: 500
  #   time: "48:00:00"
  #   memory: "32G"
