# Quick Summary: 29 Warnings Found

## Are They a Problem? **No! ✅**

These are **style/best practice warnings**, not errors. Your code works perfectly fine.

## Breakdown

- **16 warnings**: Unused parameters (prefix with `_` to suppress)
- **10 warnings**: Implicit closure parameters (use explicit `param` instead of `it`)
- **3 warnings**: Unused variables (can be removed)

## Impact

❌ **Won't break your code** - everything runs fine
✅ **Good to fix** - cleaner code, follows best practices
⚠️ **Future-proof** - some warnings (implicit closures) may break in future Nextflow versions

## Recommendation

**Option 1: Fix now** (takes ~2 minutes)
- I can automatically fix all 29 warnings
- Clean, maintainable code
- No functional changes

**Option 2: Leave for later**
- Code works fine as-is
- Can fix incrementally
- No urgency

Would you like me to fix them all now? It's quick and safe!
